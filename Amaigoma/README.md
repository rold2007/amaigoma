# Project Description

This library is a playground for new machine learning algorithms leveraging numl.net.

It will have the following features:
- Online training. Adding more data to training doesn't require to train the model from scratch.
- Simple way to detect and repair overfitting.
- Integrated feature generation.

It will make it simple to use small data. Having better quality data/features gives better accuracy/performance than big data.
